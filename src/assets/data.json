The fully intact cherries are then laid on large concrete patios or raised beds and left to ferment and dry for two to four weeks. The dried cherries turn dark purple in color and less round.

The fully intact cherries are put in water to sort out any defect. They then go through a de-pulper that will remove the outer skin and pulp as well as some or most of the mucilage from the green coffee itself.
